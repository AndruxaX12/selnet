This is a placeholder for beep.mp3. You need to create a short audio file (100ms sine wave beep) and save it as beep.mp3 in the public directory.

You can create this using online tools like:
- https://www.online-convert.com/
- https://www.audacityteam.org/ (free software)
- Or use any other audio editor

The file should be a short, pleasant notification sound that plays when new notifications arrive.
